## About

Born and raised Bilbao, I am now living in the UK to study Electronic and Information Engineering in Imperial College London. It has thus far been an exciting experience in such a vibrant city and such a thrilling educational environment. As a fencer I was drawn to electronics at the end of my high school when I tried to develop a fencing score box for my club, parting with 0 programing or hardware experience. This sparked a passion for engineering and I took the great leap of venturing abroad to pursue a carreer in a topic I have found increasingly interesting. New challenges in a new placei. I am now year rep for my uni year instead of my high shool year, and fence for my uni team across the UK instead of my club across Spain.

NB: My full name is Jes√∫s Erlantz Garcia Condado (Name Middle-name First-surname Second-surname) so when I use Jesus Garcia is just to keep it simple. Weird as it is having such a long name I am still very proud of having a Basque middle name and as is normal in Spain, also keeping my mothers surname :smile:
