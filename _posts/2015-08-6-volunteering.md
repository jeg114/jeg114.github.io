Before moving into London for my studies I have always lived in Bilbao. I was fortunate enough to have a family very keen in providing me an outstanding education at an international school. Now I am even more thankful for studying abroad at Imperial, but it is partly thanks to those who supported me back in Bilbao. That is why last summer I felt like giving back to my community by doing volunteer work. I joined an international work camp with the aim to recover and preserve the mining heritage. I chose this organization because Bilbao developed thanks to the mining industry, both my grandparents having jobs related to it.

In the work camp I was one of the few locals amongst a very diverse group in terms of nationalities, ages and professional orientations. The work was mainly handwork and required techniques none of us new. Moreover we were split into groups that took turns to work in three different projects. These involved reconstructing an old wooden mining tower used to transport the iron by a cable car, cleaning forest areas surrounding the mines, and carefully scraping rusty paint in order to preserve mining tools in a museum. In a small period of time we had to learn how to carry out each task, with the added difficulty that the instructors rarely spoke English.

I therefore undertook in most occasions the task of translating the tasks to my group and organizing how the work should be done. This was very satisfying because it involved a lot of communication with the museumÂ´s managers. They not only provided a lot of cultural background to the work we did but also displayed their gratitude towards our efforts. However in the work done building the tower we encountered a hostile environment, for our employer had had problems with the organization responsible for the work camp. Even if we were not responsible for this the employer treated us unprofessionally. Nonetheless we continued our work as effectively as we could, trying not to be part of the problem.  

Overall the experience was very positive. I learned to leave my comfort zone, for the work was not related to my studies and I had no previous experience. This helped me enhance my communication and teamwork skills in different work environments. Furthermore the different manual skills learned improved my learning and adaptation skills. The positive outcome of the experience makes me look forward to taking new challenges.
