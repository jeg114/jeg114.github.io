Two of Imperial's greatest highlights for me have been the flexibility over the courses you take and the vast amount of practical work you get to do. During this 3rd year we have been able to choose all of our modules. A new introduction to machine learning course was started this year, which I ventured to do and found it asinteresting as challenging. 

Throughout the course we have not only learned the fundamental theory behind machine learning but have also applied it in a variety of scenarios. The result was 4 extensive reports solving problems through a mix of maths and programing. <!--break-->

The programing was open and implementations varied, but the importance was placed on the analysis of the results. I personally chose python because of its versatility, quick developement process and the available machine learning libraries, such as [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org). 

All the code and the reports can be found in this Github repository. I have gathered here some main features of each report:
