My own website has gone live! Well here you are taking a look at it. I have here gathered a collection of projects I have been involved with. Hit on archives below or in Projets above to see a bigger list. Feel free to explore around and drop any comments or suggestions.

This website itself has been my most recent project and my first time making one. I had have very light contact with html before but I am always up for a challenge. I must really thank [Pannos Sakkos](https://github.com/PanosSakkos) for providing his theme [{Personal}](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) open source under an MIT licenses.

The theme is created on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is a great tool to creat static websites that work really well with GitHub-Pages, where the website is hosted. Having used a wide varitey of programing languages and tools before, and specially being comfortable working with Git, has made this project an exciting and achievable new experience. 

All the code can be found in the [websites repository](https://github.com/jeg114/jeg114.github.io.git) on github.
