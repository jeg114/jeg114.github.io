During my years at school, obtaining top grades was always a priority. However on some occasions it was not challenging enough, and so I also attended afterschool to a music school. The Spanish music degree requires of attendance and examination in a variety of thorough courses, such as Music History and Musical analysis, to complement your main instrument’s studies, in my case the Piano. This involved many hours of afterschool classes as well as studying.

Unlike my math, physics or other school subjects’ skills, my musical skills are far more limited. It was during my musical studies that I first encountered failure. Yet this was always a challenge, and I never intended to give up. The biggest challenge I encountered was during my penultimate year, when I injured my hand during a ski accident. Up until then I had been studying the piano for an hour daily, but with my injury I faced a month’s delay in my studies. I persevered by studying only with my left hand and reviewing and hearing the right hand. Once I was recovered, I developed a very strict study plan to make my studies more efficient. On the other hand I also prepared myself mentally for failure, assuming if necessary I could take a retake exam. This self-awareness and the trust in all my effort allowed me to take the exam as calm as I never had, performing as well as I could. 

My work, effort and confidence paid off, and the passing grade I obtained was one of my proudest exam results. I then kept on to fulfill the degree, which I consider to be one of my greatest achievement. The overcoming of this challenge not only developed my tolerance to failure but improved my perseverance, my organization and stress managing skills.
