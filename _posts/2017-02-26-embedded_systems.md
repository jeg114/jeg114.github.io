IoT has recently been quite a buzzword, and I hope more it will become more than that and live up to its expectations. I believe it will be a new technological revolution, the revolution of our time. As so I was excited to be part of the first cohort at imperial to take a newly design Embedded Systems course, with a strong focus on IoT. As part of it we had the chance to develop in our groups our own idea into an IoT project.

Every group was given a micro-python programable board with a wifi module. We were also given two sensors per group which varied greatly from light sensors, to accelerometors or even seismometers! Each group had then to come up with their unique IoT product and develop it from a concept into a presentable prototype. This included not only programing the board, a server and a user application but also developing the idea from a business perspective. 

My group was given a light and a humidity sensor, which we identifies as essential components for an internet connected plant monitoring system. Since it was an open project we ventured further into adding a servo to be able to automatically water the plant. The final prototype was capable of interacting through an MQTT broker with a server deployed in one computer and a user application in another machine. Through this system the prototype could display the most recent information, as well as the overall status of the plant and even automatically water the plant.
